# Aside.
Mission, principles and strategy.
## Mission
To create the radically private form of digital communication - for those who need it most.
---
## Principles
- Radical privacy
No accounts. No logs. No trace.
Built for activists, journalists, and anyone who can’t afford exposure.
Cryptography-first. Audited. Transparent. Real-world tested.
- Radical openness
Open code. Minimal stack. Forkable by design.
Made to extend, remix, and stay compatible,
because privacy is a culture, not only code.
- Radical minimalism
No onboarding. No bloat. No dark patterns.
Presence, precision, and instant disappearance.
Less isn’t less - it’s safety.
If you're building something outside these principles,
you’re not building Aside.

## Strategy
### 1. Serve those who can’t afford to be under surveillance.
Aside is for moments where self-censorship feels like safety.
A friend in an oppressed country, sharing truth with a peer abroad
confident there’ll be no logs, no trace,
even if their phone is unlocked under duress.
A journalist in a hostile zone, no time to set up, no one to trust.
They open Aside.
If it worked, there’s no proof it ever existed.
### 2. Build the fork-first foundation.
Aside is a base - not a brand.
Built for devs who can’t speak out loud.
A developer inside "evilcorp," moonlighting on something that matters,
forking Aside with one change for their own network.
No gatekeeping. No bloat. No web of dependencies.
Forking is the strategy.
It’s not about adoption of one app.
It’s about a solid core that multiplies verifiable trust.
### 3. Harden for real-world failure.
Aside isn’t built for ideal networks.
It’s built for chaos:
– Patchy signal
– No cloud
– No third-party invites
The app must allow invites without identity.
Maybe that’s mesh, Keycard, or QR bursts.
But if presence requires identity stored in the app
it’s already a risk.
Aside must work when nothing else does.
### 4. Resist creep.
Feature creep is slow death.
So is growth for its own sake.
Aside says no to:
– Features not aligned with principles
– VC funding, only common good grants
– Anything that slows the message
– Anything that dilutes the mission
Do what matters. Leave ego behind.
### 5. Move fast where it counts.
This isn’t theoretical. It’s urgent.
– Get the first APK in real hands
– Ask cryptographers to break it
– Test it under pressure
– Listen to those who need it to survive
– Build in the open, fail in the open, learn in the open
The people we’re building for don’t have the luxury of waiting.
